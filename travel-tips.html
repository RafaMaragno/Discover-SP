            <h3>Is São Paulo safe for tourists?</h3>
            <p>São Paulo is a huge metropolis (over 12 million people in the metro area), which means there are safe,
                modern districts and some areas best avoided at night. Follow some big-city precautions: stay in
                well-reviewed areas like <strong>Paulista</strong>, <strong>Jardins</strong> and <strong>Itaim
                    Bibi</strong>, avoid isolated places after dark, keep phone and wallet in front pockets or inside a
                zipped bag, carry only needed cash (cards are widely accepted) and choose licensed transport.</p>

            <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
            <h4>Is it safe to walk at night?</h4>
            <p>Walking at night is fine in well-lit areas like Paulista, Jardins, Itaim Bibi or Vila Madalena.
                Avoid walking alone in little-used side streets and always prefer a ride if you're unsure.</p>
            <!--<p><em>(Optional space for image here)</em></p>-->
            <h4>Can I drink tap water?</h4>
            <p>Tap water in São Paulo is generally treated and safe, but there's a risk of it becoming
                contaminated by impurities found in poorly maintained pipes and water tanks. Therefore, always
                choose water that has been filtered or purified.</p>
            <!--<p><em>(Optional space for image here)</em></p>-->
            <h4>What number to call in an emergency?</h4>
            <p>Police: <strong>190</strong> / Ambulance: <strong>192</strong> / Fire: <strong>193</strong>.<br>
                Keep your accommodation address written down in Portuguese to show if needed.</p>
